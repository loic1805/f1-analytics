# F1 Telemetry Analytics 🏎️

## What is this?
Welcome to my digital pit wall. I'm building this tool to better understand the marginal gains in Formula 1. As an aspiring Data Engineer/Analyst, I wanted to move beyond the streaming and try to look at the raw telemetry myself.

The purpose of this little project is quite simple: **Take two drivers, overlay their data and figure out exactly where the lap time was won or lost.**

## The Tech Stack
I'm keeping the stack focused on industry standards:
* **Python 3.10+**
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**
* **Pandas**
* **FastF1** for accessing the official F1 data

## Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Basic speed trace overlay (Who's faster on the straights?)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Corner analysis (Braking points and throttle application)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Tire degradation modeling (The long run)
